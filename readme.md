trying to code up the common data structures/algos all in one place. hoping this may help at least one person put the pieces together when it comes to data structures and algos. i'm not a python whiz, so the code should be relatively straightforward to read and comprehend (hopefully). trying to leave comments as i go - enough to get the point across but not so much as to be considered a fkn book

i don't have a phd/masters/undergrad degree in comp sci, my iq isn't 180, and i'm very bad at s3x. if you see room for improvement or spot a bug, don't be a dick about it - my self-esteem can't take too many more hits. just lmk or raise a pr (idk what the non-enterprise/open-source standards are)
