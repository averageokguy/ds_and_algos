trying to code up the common data structures/algos all in one place. hoping this may help at least one person put the pieces together when it comes to data structures and algos. i'm not a python whiz, so the code should be relatively straightforward to read and comprehend (hopefully). trying to leave comments as i go - enough to get the point across but not so much as to be considered a fkn book

if you're like me and some things just don't click for whatever reason, pull down the repo and debug to see what's happening under the hood. besides drawing sht out, this is my favorite way to attempt to understand what's goin on. all .py files should be debuggable as is

i don't have a phd/masters/undergrad degree in comp sci, my iq isn't 180, and i'm very bad at s3x. if you see room for improvement or spot a bug, don't be a dick about it - my self-esteem can't take too many more hits. just lmk or raise a pr (idk what the non-enterprise/open-source standards are)

ps, imo, i think it's a best practice to actually code this sht out yourself. maybe try it in your preferred language, and raise a pr here if you want to contribute so that, in the unlikely event this gets lotsa viewers, there will be solutions in various langs

thanks, glhf
